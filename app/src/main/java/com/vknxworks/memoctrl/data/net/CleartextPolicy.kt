/**
 * Plain HTTP is allowed by the platform (many Memos servers live on a home network), so the app
 * enforces it instead: an unencrypted request only goes out to a server address the user chose
 * (an http:// address they typed, or confirmed after HTTPS failed). Everything else must be HTTPS.
 * Installed as a network interceptor, so every redirect hop is checked: an HTTP hop is allowed only
 * when both the hop's own address and the address the call was started for are allowed HTTP
 * addresses (so an HTTPS request can never be redirected down to HTTP, and an allowed server can't
 * send the app on to another host in cleartext).
